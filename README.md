# Implementation of Logistic Regression Model for Classifying Food Choices for Diabetic Patients

## AIM:
To implement a logistic regression model to classify food items for diabetic patients based on nutrition information.

## Equipments Required:
1. Hardware – PCs
2. Anaconda – Python 3.7 Installation / Jupyter notebook

## Algorithm
1. Data Collection and Preprocessing Load the food nutrition dataset, handle missing values, encode categorical labels, and normalize the nutritional features using scaling techniques.

2. Data Splitting Split the dataset into training and testing sets using an appropriate ratio (e.g., 80% training and 20% testing).

3. Model Training Train a Logistic Regression model using the training dataset to learn the relationship between nutritional features and diabetic suitability.

4. Model Evaluation and Prediction Test the model on the testing dataset and evaluate performance using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix. Use the trained model to classify food items as suitable or unsuitable for diabetic patients.

#First, let's split the the training and testing dataset

#Our classification problem is multinomial
multi_class='multinomial'

#Use of lbfgs for L2 penalty and multinomial classes

#Max iteration=1000

#Define a logistic regression model with the  above arguments
